# NLW-IA üí¨

---

Repository will contain the project code - Front-end and Back-end developed during the week of NLW-IA 13th Edition

---

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
   parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
   },
```

# Tecnical details

In the past week, the Rocketseat NLW event took place, with a special edition focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI). A project was developed using the OpenAI API, which involves uploading a video for the API to transcribe into text. Additionally, it generates coherent titles and descriptions based on the content of the uploaded video.

For the front-end development, React.js, Tailwind.css, Shadcn for styled components, and Web Assembly were used. Web Assembly is a technology that allows us to run things on the web that are not traditionally web-based, among other technologies.

On the back-end side, Node.js was employed, along with Fastify to handle API requests and routes, and Prisma as the database ORM, among other technologies.
